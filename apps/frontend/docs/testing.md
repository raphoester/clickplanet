# Testing

`vitest`, co-located as `*.test.ts(x)`. The suite runs on **node by default** —
most of it is domain logic with no DOM. Files that render components opt in with
a `// @vitest-environment jsdom` comment on the first line, so the rest are not
slowed down by a jsdom each.

`TileField` is testable without a GPU because `BufferAttribute` is plain arrays;
only `GpuPicker` genuinely needs a WebGL context, which is why it is kept as
thin as it is.
